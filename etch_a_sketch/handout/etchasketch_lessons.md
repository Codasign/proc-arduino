Arduino Etch A Sketch Workshop
======================

## What is an Etch A Sketch?

An Etch A Sketch is a drawing toy that was sold by the Ohio Art Company. It was first sold in the 1960s.  The toy draws a line using two controllers: a knob that changes the horizontal position and a second knob for the vertical position.  To erase what has been drawn, the toy is flipped upside down and is shaken.

We are going to mimic this interaction using Arduino and Processing.  We will use Processing to draw on a computer, and we will control that drawing using two potentiomenters and a tactile button.
